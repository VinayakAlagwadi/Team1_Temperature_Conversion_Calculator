Feasibility Study: 

What: Calculator to convert among temperature units.
Why: To perform calculation and change forms of temperature so as to ease it for user.
Where: Mainly used in hospitals and weather forecasting.
When: This application is used when the user wants to convert temperature from one form to another 
How: Based on the user choice the following formulas are executed:

•	Celsius to Fahrenheit: fah = (cel*9/5)+32
•	Celsius to Kelvin: kel = (cel + 273.15)
•	Fahrenheit to Celsius: cel = ((fah - 32)*5)/9
•	Fahrenheit to Kelvin: kel = ((fah - 32)*5)/9 +273.15
•	Kelvin to Celsius: cel = (kel - 273.15)
•	Kelvin to Fahrenheit: fah = ((kel - 273.15)*9)/5+32
             
Specific Requirements:
1)	High level Requirements: 
•	Software to code application
•	Data types
•	Complied by gcc C Compiler
•	Written in C

2)	Low level Requirements:
•	Need a system that supports gcc Compiler.
