# Software Requirement Specification<br />
## Temperature Conversion Calculator<br />
### Purpose:
To ease calculations and to check temperature as per user choice.<br />
Overall Description: The calculator is designed to perform functions like Fahrenheit to Celsius,
Celsius to Fahrenheit, Kelvin to Celsius, Celsius to Kelvin, Fahrenheit to Kelvin, Kelvin to Fahrenheit.<br />
### Feasibility Study: <br />
What: Calculator to convert among temperature units.<br />
Why: To perform calculation and change forms of temperature so as to ease it for user.<br />
Where: Mainly used in hospitals and weather forecasting.<br />
When: This application is used when the user wants to convert temperature from one form to another <br />
How: Based on the user choice the following formulas are executed:<br />

•	Celsius to Fahrenheit: fah = (cel*9/5)+32<br />
•	Celsius to Kelvin: kel = (cel + 273.15)<br />
•	Fahrenheit to Celsius: cel = ((fah - 32)*5)/9<br />
•	Fahrenheit to Kelvin: kel = ((fah - 32)*5)/9 +273.15<br />
•	Kelvin to Celsius: cel = (kel - 273.15)<br />
•	Kelvin to Fahrenheit: fah = ((kel - 273.15)*9)/5+32<br />
             
### Specific Requirements:<br />
1)	High level Requirements: <br />
•	Software to code application<br />
•	Data types<br />
•	Complied by gcc C Compiler<br />
•	Written in C<br />
2)	Low level Requirements:<br />
•	Need a system that supports gcc Compiler.<br />
